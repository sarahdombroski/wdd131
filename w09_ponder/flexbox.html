                <h3>Stunner</h3>
                <p>Chittaphon Leechaiyapornkul, otherwise known under the nickname Ten, released his second mini album, Stunner, on March 24, 2025. It consists of 7 songs. Ten is a Thai singer, who is also a part of the group WayV, a subunit of NCT under SM Entertainment. This album low key slaps so hard and it was my most played in the month of March. 10/10 would recommend.</p>
